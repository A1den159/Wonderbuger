firstly, in the branch 'Aiden' I added cheese to the burger on line 3 and Sheree also added tomato to the burger in the branch 'Sheree' on line 3.

I then pushed my changes to the main branch and created a pull request and merged them.

But Sheree also pushed her changes to the main branch and created a pull request and attempted to merged them.

but since both of our added lines of code were on the same line, and I pushed my code first, Sheree got a conflict when trying to branch.

so i communicated to Sheree informing her that her branch is conflicting with the base branch and then she responded by saying that she will resolve any conflicts

she then moved my line of code "Cheese (Aiden)" to line 4 and kept her "Tomato (Sheree)" on line 3 so they would not conflict with each other and then informed me that she resolved the conflicts 

Then I merged the pull request and main was updated with no further issues
